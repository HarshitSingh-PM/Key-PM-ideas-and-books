_Measure What Matters_ is a deep dive into **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)**, a goal-setting system pioneered at Intel by Andy Grove and popularized by John Doerr at Google and dozens of other successful organizations. The book argues that OKRs are a primary driver of execution excellence, helping organizations focus, align, track, and achieve their most important goals.

The core philosophy is simple: An **Objective** is the "WHAT" - a significant, concrete, action-oriented, and inspirational goal. **Key Results** are the "HOW" - measurable, verifiable, and specific metrics that benchmark progress toward the objective. At the end of a period, you grade your KRs (typically on a 0-1.0 scale) to see if you achieved your objective.

The book is structured in two parts:

1.  **OKRs in Action:** Explains the system's origin and its four "superpowers."
    
2.  **The New World of Work:** Explores how OKRs integrate with modern performance management (CFRs) to create a high-performance culture.
    

----------

### Part 1: OKRs in Action & The Four Superpowers

#### 1. The Origin and Basics of OKRs

-   **Father of OKRs:** Andy Grove at Intel, who built upon Peter Drucker's "Management by Objectives" (MBOs) but made it more agile, transparent, and less tied to compensation.
    
-   **Core Definition:**
    
    -   **Objective:** "Simply _WHAT_ is to be achieved, no more and no less... significant, concrete, action oriented, and (ideally) inspirational."
        
    -   **Key Results:** "Benchmark and monitor _HOW_ we get to the objective. Effective KRs are specific and time-bound, aggressive yet realistic. Most of all, they are measurable and verifiable... 'It’s not a key result unless it has a number.'" - Marissa Mayer
        
-   **The Google Story:** Doerr introduced OKRs to a young Google in 1999. Larry Page credits OKRs with "changing the course of the company forever," helping them scale and achieve their audacious mission.
    

#### 2. Superpower #1: Focus and Commit to Priorities

OKRs force organizations to identify and commit to their most important work.

-   **Less is More:** Doerr and Grove emphasize that fewer goals lead to greater focus. Aim for **3-5 OKRs per cycle**. "If you try to focus on everything, you focus on nothing."
    
-   **Public Commitment:** Leaders must not only set goals but also publicly model commitment to them. As Bill Campbell said, "if you don’t model it, no one’s going to do it."
    
-   **Quality of KRs:** Key Results must be succinct, specific, and measurable. A good practice is to **pair quantity and quality KRs** (e.g., "Process 500 vouchers" paired with "Achieve a 99.8% accuracy rate") to avoid the pitfalls of one-dimensional goals (like the Ford Pinto scandal).
    

> **Key Excerpt:** "The one thing an [OKR] system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small." - Andy Grove


#### 3. Superpower #2: Align and Connect for Teamwork

Transparent OKRs create organizational clarity and connectivity, breaking down silos.

-   **Transparency is Default:** In an OKR system, everyone's goals are visible to everyone else. This fosters meritocracy, surfaces redundant efforts, and sparks collaboration.
    
-   **Beyond Cascading:** While top-down "cascading" of goals has its place, the most powerful OKR systems blend top-down direction with **bottom-up input**. Doerr suggests a **50/50 mix** is often ideal. This gives frontline employees a sense of ownership and taps into their innovative potential (e.g., Google's "20% time" that led to Gmail).
    
-   **Cross-functional Coordination:** Public OKRs make dependencies between teams obvious, allowing them to coordinate _before_ a project slips.
    

> **Key Excerpt:** "With OKR transparency, everyone’s goals - from the CEO down - are openly shared... By connecting each contributor to the organization’s success, top-down alignment brings meaning to work. By deepening people’s sense of ownership, bottom-up OKRs foster engagement and innovation."

    

#### 4. Superpower #3: Track for Accountability

OKRs are a living, breathing system driven by data and regular check-ins.

-   **Regular Check-ins:** Unlike static annual goals, OKRs require **weekly or monthly check-ins** to monitor progress, identify risks, and course-correct. This is where the "tracking" happens.
    
-   **Adaptability:** During check-ins, you have four options for each OKR: **Continue, Update, Start, or Stop**. This flexibility is key to staying agile.
    
-   **Scoring and Reflection:** At the end of the cycle, you score your OKRs objectively (Google uses a 0.0-1.0 scale) and then engage in a subjective **self-assessment and reflection**. The goal is learning, not judgment.
    
    -   **0.7-1.0 (Green) =** Great achievement.
        
    -   **0.4-0.6 (Yellow) =** Progress made, but fell short.
        
    -   **0.0-0.3 (Red) =** Failed to make real progress.
        

> **Key Excerpt:** "An endangered key result triggers action to get it back on track, or to revise or replace it if warranted."


    

#### 5. Superpower #4: Stretch for Amazing

OKRs are designed to push teams to achieve more than they thought possible.

-   **"Stretch" Goals:** Also known as "Moonshots" or "BHAGs" (Big Hairy Audacious Goals), these are ambitious, high-risk goals that inspire innovation and breakthrough performance.
    
-   **The Gospel of 10x:** At Google, the culture isn't about 10% improvement but 10x growth. Larry Page believes that aiming for 10x forces you to rethink problems entirely, rather than just making incremental tweaks.
    
-   **It's Okay to Fail:** For aspirational OKRs, a **0.7 score is considered a success**. A 1.0 might indicate the goal wasn't ambitious enough. "If you set a crazy, ambitious goal and miss it, you'll still achieve something remarkable." - Larry Page

> **Key Excerpt:** "Bad companies are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them." - Andy Grove (from the Intel "Operation Crush" story)

### Part 2: The New World of Work

#### 6. Continuous Performance Management: OKRs and CFRs

Doerr argues that annual performance reviews are broken. They are replaced by a continuous system that works in tandem with OKRs, called **CFRs**:

-   **Conversations:** Authentic, ongoing, two-way dialogues between managers and employees about goals, progress, and career growth.
    
-   **Feedback:** Bidirectional or networked communication among peers to evaluate work and guide future improvement.
    
-   **Recognition:** Public appreciation for efforts and achievements, large and small.
    

**The Synergy:** OKRs provide the clear, measurable goals (the "what"). CFRs provide the human context, coaching, and motivation (the "how" and "why"). Together, they create a complete operating system for excellence.

> **Key Excerpt:** "If a conversation is limited to whether you achieved the goal or not, you lose context... On the other hand, if you don’t have goals, what the heck are you talking about?"

#### 7. The Amicable Divorce: OKRs and Compensation

A critical best practice is to **decouple OKR scores from compensation and bonuses**.

-   **Why?** If bonuses are directly tied to hitting 100% of OKRs, employees will sandbag by setting easy, low-risk goals. This kills innovation and the spirit of stretching for amazing.
    
-   **The Solution:** Keep the conversations separate. Use OKRs and CFRs for **development and performance**. Use other, broader criteria for **compensation and promotion**.
    
#### 8. Ditching Annual Performance Reviews: The Adobe Story

This chapter provides a powerful case study of a company that successfully replaced a dreaded annual process with a system of ongoing check-ins.

-   **The Problem:** Adobe's traditional performance review system was a classic "rank and yank" process. It was time-consuming, demotivating, and fostered internal competition rather than collaboration. Managers spent 80,000 hours a year on the process, and voluntary employee turnover spiked during review season.
    
-   **The Solution: "Check-in."** In 2012, Adobe boldly eliminated annual reviews and replaced them with a system of regular, informal conversations between managers and employees, with no required forms or ratings. The system is built on three pillars:
    
    1.  **Set clear expectations.** (This is where OKRs live).
        
    2.  **Provide regular feedback.**
        
    3.  **Drive growth and development.**
        
-   **The Result:** The change was a massive success. After the implementation, Adobe saw a **30% reduction in voluntary turnover** and was named a "Best Place to Work" more than 50 times. The "Check-in" system empowered managers to be coaches and created a more agile and honest workplace.
    

> **Key Excerpt (from an Adobe employee):** "The conversations are more honest now... There are no surprises. You don’t have to wait until the end of the year to know how you are doing."

#### 9. Baking Better Every Day: The Zume Pizza Story

This chapter illustrates how OKRs and CFRs can be used in a non-tech, operational-heavy business to drive continuous improvement.

-   **The Company:** Zume Pizza was a startup using robotics and automation to make and deliver pizza. Their operation was a complex interplay of food science, manufacturing, logistics, and customer service.
    
-   **OKRs for Operational Excellence:** Zume used OKRs at every level to create focus and alignment in a fast-changing environment. Examples included:
    
    -   **Company OKR:** "Produce and deliver a pizza of superior quality and value, on time, every time."
        
    -   **Key Results:** "Achieve a 4+ star rating," "Reduce delivery time to under 15 minutes," "Hold food costs to <25% of revenue."
        
-   **CFRs in the Kitchen:** The culture was built on constant feedback. Employees were encouraged to call out problems immediately ("I need a coach") without fear of blame. This created a "just culture" focused on solving problems, not punishing people. Daily shift huddles and weekly leadership meetings kept everyone aligned on the OKRs.
    

> **Key Insight:** The Zume story shows that OKRs and CFRs are not just for software engineers. They are a universal system for creating discipline, accountability, and a learning mindset in any operational context.

#### 10. The Importance of Culture (Chapters 18, 19, and 20)

This section argues that OKRs and CFRs are not just management tools but powerful levers for shaping and changing workplace culture.

-   **OKRs Catalyze Culture; CFRs Nourish It:** The transparency of OKRs fosters a culture of accountability and purpose. The ongoing conversations and feedback of CFRs build trust, psychological safety, and a sense of community.
    
-   **Culture Change: The Lumeris Story:** This healthcare company was struggling with a culture of "alignment without accountability." They implemented OKRs to create clarity and focus. The key lesson was that **leadership must fully commit** and be the first to model the new behaviors. As one leader noted, "We had to change the way we ran the company... OKRs gave us the vehicle."
    
-   **Culture Change: Bono's ONE Campaign Story:** Perhaps the most unexpected case study, it shows how OKRs brought discipline and measurable impact to a global non-profit.
    
    -   **The Challenge:** The ONE Campaign, dedicated to fighting extreme poverty and preventable disease, was passionate and mission-driven but struggled to show concrete results to its donors and supporters.
        
    -   **The OKR Solution:** Bono and the leadership adopted OKRs to bring a "capitalist rigour" to their activist zeal. They learned to set specific, measurable goals like "Secure $1.15 billion in funding for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria." This shifted the conversation from "We're trying" to "We will deliver."
        
    -   **The Impact:** OKRs helped ONE become a more effective advocacy organization, contributing to tangible outcomes like millions of people receiving life-saving medication.
        

> **Key Excerpt (from a ONE Campaign staffer):** "OKRs have turned us into a more professional, more focused, and more efficient organization... We are no longer a loose collection of well-intentioned people."

#### 11. The Goals to Come & Conclusion

The book concludes by revisiting the legacy of Andy Grove and Bill Campbell, emphasizing that the true power of OKRs lies in their combination with the human touch of CFRs.

-   **A Lasting Legacy:** The system is a gift from the "golden age of Silicon Valley" that is more relevant today than ever.
    
-   **The Final Message:** Doerr's closing argument is that OKRs are a "framework for the future," providing the clarity, commitment, and alignment needed to navigate a complex world. When paired with CFRs, they create an environment where people can find meaning and fulfillment in their work by contributing to something larger than themselves.

### Key Takeaways & Implementation Tips (From the Book and Beyond)

1.  **Start Small:** Pilot OKRs with one team or department before a company-wide rollout.
    
2.  **Less is More:** Limit the number of OKRs to ensure focus. 3-5 company-level OKRs, with 3-5 KRs each, is the sweet spot.
    
3.  **Embrace Transparency:** Make all OKRs public within the organization. This is non-negotiable.
    
4.  **No Dictating:** Encourage a mix of top-down and bottom-up goal setting. Teams should have a say in their Key Results.
    
5.  **It's a Cycle, Not a Task:** OKRs require quarterly (or monthly) cycles of setting, checking, grading, and reflecting. It's a rhythm.
    
6.  **Stretch for Amazing:** Have at least one aspirational goal that makes the team slightly uncomfortable.
    
7.  **Use the Right Tools:** While you can start with spreadsheets, dedicated OKR software (like WorkBoard, Gtmhub, [Ally.io](https://ally.io/), etc.) significantly improves transparency, tracking, and alignment at scale.
    
8.  **Be Patient:** It takes most organizations 2-3 quarterly cycles to become proficient with OKRs. "Building goal muscle" takes time.
9.   **CFRs Make OKRs Human:** The Adobe and Zume stories prove that the "soft" work of conversations, feedback, and recognition is what brings the "hard" data of OKRs to life. You cannot have one without the other.
    
2.  **Culture is the Operating System:** OKRs will fail if the culture is not supportive. Conversely, implementing OKRs and CFRs is one of the most effective ways to _change_ a culture from one of ambiguity and fear to one of clarity and psychological safety.
    
3.  **Universal Applicability:** The system works for a 100,000-person tech giant (Adobe), a robotics pizza startup (Zume), a healthcare company (Lumeris), and a global philanthropic campaign (ONE). The principles are adaptable to any context where people need to achieve something together.
    
4.  **Leadership Commitment is Non-Negotiable:** In every successful case study, from Google to Nuna to Lumeris, change started at the top. Leaders must not only endorse the system but actively participate in it and be vulnerable in their own goal-setting and grading.
